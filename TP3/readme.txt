Project Description:
	This project is a game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, where the winner of each spot on the board is determined by the outcome of a "sub-game." This version has a twist, in that each sub-game is a game of 3D Tic Tac Toe, where pieces can be played in the vertical, horizontal, or normal axes. Players alternate picking the location of the sub-game, and the player who picks the sub-game gets to go first for that sub-game. Theres are both single-player and two-player modes, where the former involves playing against the computer, and the latter is between two individuals.


Running the game:
	This program is coded using Python, so an editor that can run Python scripts is required. Ensure that the TP3.py and the cmu_112_graphics.py files are both present in the same directory (this should be the case by default). Open the TP3.py file in an editor, and run the script.


Code Libraries:
	TP3.py uses the tkinter module, which is called using cmu_112_graphics.py, so no extra steps are necessary to run the game.


Shortcut Commands:
	Hitting the "r" key while in a 3D sub-game will reset the 3D game board, without returning to the primary 2D board.
